Dear $username,


Congratulations! Your private parking located at $unitaddress has been successfully added to our system.

Since your parking is located near $poiname the system will notify you a few days upfront via email every time an event is upcoming.
In this email, you will have the possibility to indicate if your parking can be rented out or not. As a result, you will always be in control of your parking.

The commercial conditions are as follows:
1. To help cover the costs of running Parking Plaza, we charge a 35% service fee every time a parking reservation is confirmed.
2. You will be paid at the beginning of each calendar month by bank transfer (we will execute the payment on working day 4). The amount that we will transfer to your bank account will be the total amount received for the rental of your private parking of the previous month minus our service fee.

You can consult details of your user account, private parking, parking schedule and Terms Of Service on our website https://www.parking-plaza.com.


Thank you for using Parking Plaza and make sure you get the most out of your parking!
